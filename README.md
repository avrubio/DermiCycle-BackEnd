# DermiCycle-BackEnd

DermiCycle is a skin care cycling application that allows you to track what products to use at what stage.

## Introduction

 The term "skin cycling" is all about taking a cyclical approach to your facial skincare routine. Why? Using specific products on different days regenerates the skin and improves skin quality. Choose between a four-night or a three-night cycle alternates an exfoliant, retinol-based product, and hydrating cream or concentrate.
